This is a fork of [Tesseract](http://tesseract.gg/), which is a fork of the [Cube 2](http://cubeengine.com/).

I have no specific goals with this fork, just adding features as necessary for my own projects.

The master branch is a clone of the [SVN repository](http://websvn.tuxfamily.org/tesseract/main/) as of 8/23/2019. New additions will go on separate branches.
